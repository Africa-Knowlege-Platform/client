# Africa Knowledge Platform
The Africa Knowledge Platform is a gateway to data and information on Africa's social, economic, territorial and environmental development, developed and hosted by the Joint Research Centre of the European Commission.
Featuring data, methods and models developed in-house and with African partners, this platform supports the European policy objective of building a comprehensive strategy for Africa, under the umbrella of the European Commission priority of building "A stronger Europe in the world" (year 2019-2024). Using the platform, you can search data and maps by theme, by location or by Sustainable Development Goals. As well as country and regional profiles, you can deep-dive into specific topics, and explore the range of JRC's scientific and technical partnerships and projects across Africa.
